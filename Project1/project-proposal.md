Project Name: JobTab – One Tab for Your Entire Job Search

Members: Me 

Description: A job application tracker that uses local storage to help job seekers organize. Job hunting is chaotic…spreadsheets get messy, bookmarks pile up, and critical details get lost. This tool centralizes everything in one clean interface: applications, statuses, recruiter contacts, interview notes, and follow-up reminders.

User Personas:
Recent graduate juggling 50+ applications across LinkedIn, company sites, and referrals who needs a single source of truth
Career switcher managing a slower search who wants detailed notes on each opportunity and contact
Anyone actively job hunting who’s tired of forgetting which companies they applied to or when they last followed up

User Stories: 
As a job seeker, I want to add applications with company name, role, link, and date so I can keep a complete record
As a job seeker, I want to update application status (applied → interview → offer/rejected) so I know where I stand
As a job seeker, I want to attach notes to each application so I can track recruiter names, interview prep, and follow-ups
As a job seeker, I want to filter by status so I can focus on active opportunities
As a job seeker, I want to mark priority applications, so I know which ones need my attention first
As a job seeker, I want to set follow-up reminders so I don’t forget to send thank-you emails or check in after interviews
